# SML Server
###### An attempt at a web server in Standard ML

- Now have minimally working multi-client server using `Socket.select`
- Need to think a bit about (these points will probably be related)
	1. Along what dimensions we'd like to customize this server
	2. How we'll write handlers
	3. How to expose this functionality via structures
